                  <p class="text">This artifact is important for several reasons.  This project demonstrates skills I acquired in the use of survey research.  Survey research techniques is a skill that I have already used outside of the classroom and so this demonstrates the importance of something that I learned.  This assignment specifically delves into an area of great research interest to me and I was allowed to begin formulating a research survey that I could use in the future.  Finally, this assignment gave me the skills to use several new research tools that I had never been exposed to before.</p>

                  <p class="text">The purpose of this project was to create an evaluation tool to look at an education problem that you were interested in.  This artifact is the result of this and I found it to be an important tool in my arsenal for completing further research that I have already conducted.  Designing the tool to fit the needs of the project is an important component in answering the research questions you pose.</p>

                  <p class="text"><b>Objective 3 - Distinguish between ethical and unethical behavior when conducting educational research or evaluations</b></p>
                  <p class="text">Ethics is an important part of survey design.  It is important that all responses are randomized to ensure the confidentiality of all participants.  Participants expect this confidentiality in not only the information they give, but also the way in which you use the information they contribute to your research.  Ethics demands that all responses be wiped of all identifying marks.</p>

                  <p class="text">Selecting the appropriate technological survey tool is important to ensure that you are able to complete the necessary analysis for your project.  For this artifact I chose Qualtrics because it was easy to use, provided great data management capabilities and allowed me to gather the data and analyze it largely within the program itself.  This tool was exactly what was needed to be able to complete this job.</p>

                    <p class="text">I presented this project to my ETR 540 class in a poster defense format.  This allowed students and faculty to look at the work and provide feedback on what they saw.  They helped me to think about ways I could improve my work.  They provided help and guidance on items that may have seemed unclear to them.</p>
