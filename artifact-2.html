                  <p class="text">I specifically choose this artifact because it shows my early work when I was beginning to get more interested in this field.  This artifact looks closely at the workload of faculty members and how it varies between the genders.  At the time I had seen some research on this specific topic and found it interesting and so I wanted to look at it myself for this class.  This assignment required me to select an analysis type that fit my research questions as per the requirements.  It also looks at diversity in the educational workplace and that is important to myself and the field as a whole.</p>

                  <p class="text">In this assignment we were given several different methods to analyze the data that we collected.  We had to decide what was and was not the best method to be able to answer our research questions.  To do this, I had to look at the questions and then the data to determine how I could best get the answers I was seeking.  </p>

                  <p class="text">This study looks at the problem of bias in the workload assigned to faculty members at various universities throughout the US.  The problem was highlighted in a higher education news article and some other research that was available.  The point of my study was to confirm if this was a true problem or not.  I wanted to look myself at the problem and see how the workload could be affecting the faculty of the US.</p>

Diversity is an important part of the academic world and this study was designed to shed some light on what could be a problem in the way different faculty are treated at American universities.  </p>
