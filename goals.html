    <h2>Developmental Goals</h2>
        <section class="goals-inner">
        <h3>Initial Program Goals</h3>
        <p>When I started my doctoral studies, I had no idea I would ever be pursuing a Masters in Education Research and Evaluation.  It simply was not something I thought I would be interested in.  I came into the program with a decent understanding of the basics of educational research from my first Masters of Education.  But, after taking my first couple of courses I was beginning to really become interested in this field of study. I was intrigued by the logical way in which we are able to analyze data with statistics and make it extremely understandable to the general reader.  Further, I discovered that these techniques could help me to help others with their own work.  I have always had a passion for helping others and being able to be a valuable asset to the educational research field became extremely appealing to me.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="goals-inner">
            <h3>Middle Program Goals</h3>
            <p>By the time I was entering the middle of this degree program I was really getting into the more advanced forms of statistical analysis.  Words that had been very scary to me in my early academic career, like multivariate analysis, were becoming intriguing and I looked forward to using them.  At this point I also learned a lot more about the use of surveys to collect the needed data for statistical analysis.  This new tool allows me to analyze a much wider array of topics than I would have considered before.  I also get to delve deeper into the knowledge and interests of subjects that I am working with on research projects.  Being able to create my own customized survey for each research project really ensures that I am able to answer the specific topics my research questions address.  Qualitative research is also something that I am not afraid of anymore.  I definitely now see the value in having qualitative research question and technique in studies that I design to help provide a more in-depth investigation of a research topic.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="goals-inner">
            <h3>End of Program Goals</h3>
            <p>Now that I have reached the end of my course work in this program, I have discovered that I still have a passion to learn more.  I don't think I will ever stop learning new techniques to analyze data through quantitative and qualitative methods.  At this point I have begun to explore options in this field to see what kind of positions are available to me while I finish my doctoral studies.  I look forward to being able to use my skill set that I have acquired in this program to work with others on research that benefits my field and many other fields of study.  I also look forward to have the chance to teach statistical and research methods to students.  Hopefully I will be able to share my passion for this field with them and help them better understand the value of quantitative methods.</p>
