                  <h3>Description</h3>
                  <p class="text">This article is my only real foray into the world of qualitative research.  However, I found it to be a unique and intriguing experience in my growth as a researcher.  I was able to look at a topic I was interested in and get feedback directly from students in the age group I was curious about.  The ability to ask questions directly of the subjects and then maintain a line of though beyond a simple questionnaire was very valuable to me and since I have added some qualitative research to my dissertation.</p>

                  <p class="text"><b>Objective 1 - Design a study of an educational research problem or phenomenon using appropriate methodologies</b></p>
                  <p class="text">This study I designed specifically to look at students interest in using video games in the history classroom.  I formulated some questions to ask students.  I then asked actually high school students their opinion on the topic and used their responses to answer my research questions.  Having completed this task and looking back on it I think I took away a lot from this experience.  It helped me to see that qualitative research is difficult and yet rewarding.  It allows interaction with your subjects and provides insights that might be hard to gather otherwise.</p>

                  <p class="text"><b>Objective 3 - Distinguish between ethical and unethical behavior when conducting educational research or evaluations</b></p>
                  <p class="text">This assignment allowed me to adventure into using an actual game in my research.  It was the first time I had done so and once I had, I was hooked.  The design of this study allowed me to explore ways in which to use video game technology to keep students interested in subjects that might not otherwise be their favorite.  It also helped me to explore ways in which to use this technology for my own research.<p>
