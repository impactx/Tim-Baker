                  <p class="text">This artifact is important for several reasons.  This project demonstrates skills I acquired in the use of survey research.  Survey research techniques is a skill that I have already used outside of the classroom and so this demonstrates the importance of something that I learned.  This assignment specifically delves into an area of great research interest to me and I was allowed to begin formulating a research survey that I could use in the future.  Finally, this assignment gave me the skills to use several new research tools that I had never been exposed to before.</p>

                  <p class="text">This study I designed looked at voters of a specific group within the United States.  The study looked at these using on of the many different statistical analysis techniques we learned in the course.  The results were not as I had expected and so I probably should have chosen a different study type.</p>

                  <p class="text">For this project you were given various options of looking at the data set that you had selected.  I chose to use descriptive statistics and model fit for each variable.  This project allowed me to closely look at how these tools worked in a study and ways in which I could improve my analytical techniques. </p>

                  <p class="text">This study is looking at the diversity of the United States voting population specifically.  It delves into whether voters of this specific group vote differently based on key factors.  It also looks at if there is a pattern in how this group votes as compared to other groups.  The diversity of the constituency that is looked at is the important aspect of this study.</p>
