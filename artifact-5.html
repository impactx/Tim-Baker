                  <p class="text">This artifact looks at how bullying and age can play a factor in the likelihood teenagers are to use marijuana.  The study was completed for ETR 724 and was important because it allowed me to explore the use of multilevel modeling within an academic study.  The topic was of special interest because I had seen some news that made it appear that bullying may have an affect on if teens were more or less likely to use marijuana during their very formative years.</p>

                  <p class="text">This artifact shows how I created a study based off of interests that I had gained from external new sources.  The course had taught us several multilevel methods to analyze data and we were expected to chose one that met the needs of our data and research questions we had posed.  The method I chose allowed me to look at the variables and their impact on the outcome of teen marijuana use.</p>

                  <p class="text">This artifact was presented to my ETR 724 class in a poster presentation format.  This allowed others to view my study and provide useful feedback that helped me refine it before I wrote my final paper.  This process has provided me with enough experience to feel comfortable presenting these kinds of things in front of any audience.  Being able to received and bounce ideas off your peers is important to the research process at the early stage.<p>
